# ultimate-dream

My own personall WIP combination of my favorite deepdream code snippets from around the web for generating animations and movies, Cleaned up for jupyter notebook. 

Current features:
 - Dual model deepdream animations W/ whirlpool warping
  	+ On-the-Fly modification of multiple layers/models, ocataves, scales and iterations per each frame
 	+ (optional) Adjustable blending of the original frame throughout animation
 	+ (optional) Loop through multiple guide images, single guide, or guide image generated from previous frame
